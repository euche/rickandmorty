Google Maps Android API Demos
===================================

These are demos for the [Google Maps Android API v2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/)
in the Java programming language.
They demonstrate most of the features available in the API.

This app was written for a minSdk of 15 and the v4 support library, but it can be easily adapted to
use native functionality instead.
(For example replacing ``SupportMapFragment`` with ``MapFragment``.)

Pre-requisites
